PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Check sprint-rubric-assessment.txt if you are unsure that we met requirements. We plugged our code into ChatGPT and asked it to tell us if we met all rubric requirements through our work, with examples of where we used it in our code. We believe we met all project requirements.
