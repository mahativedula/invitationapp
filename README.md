PREPOPULATED DATA

Here are 3 example users you can log into to use to test the database:
username: jane_doe
password: Abcd1234

username: john_doe
password: Abcd1234

username: jackie_doe
password: Abcd1234

=====================================================================================

Jane is hosting a birthday party that John and Jackie are invited to.
John is hosting a halloween party that Jane and Jackie are invited to.
Jackie is hosting a secret party that only Jane is invited to.

This affects the "My Events" and "My Invites" view.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Check rubric.txt if you are unsure that we met requirements. We plugged our code into ChatGPT and asked it to tell us if we met all rubric requirements through our work, with examples of where we used it in our code. We beleive we met all project requirements.
